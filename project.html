		<h2>Source of Livelihood</h2>
		<p>Most people’s main source of livelihood is farming. About 70% of people rely directly on agriculture as a livelihood. The result of the non-development of non-agricultural activities to absorb the fast-growing population is this high percentage in agriculture. Furthermore, many people are not engaged in agriculture in developed countries</p>

		<p>The agricultural sector provides fodder for domestic animals. The cow provides people with milk which is a form of protective food. Moreover, livestock also meets people’s food requirements.
         Agricultural products like sugar, tea, rice, spices, tobacco, coffee, etc. constitute the major items of exports of countries that rely on agriculture. If there is a smooth development practice of agriculture, imports are reduced while export increases considerably. This helps to reduce countries’ unfavorable balance of payments as well as saving foreign exchange. This amount may be well used to import other essential inputs, machinery, raw material, and other infrastructure that is helpful for the support of the country’s economic development.

		<p>According to the World Food Summit organised in Rome in 1996, food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe, nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active life.The three components of food security—availability (having sufficient quantities of appropriate food available), access (having adequate income or other resources to access food), and utilization/consumption (having adequate dietary intake and the ability to absorb and use nutrients in the body)—provide the basis for food.<p><b>The reasons why people experience food insecurity include: a lack of resources (including financial resources and other resources such as transport); lack of access to nutritious food at affordable prices, lack of access to food due to geographical isolation; and lack of motivation or knowledge about a nutritious diet.</b></p>

		<h2>Respect Crop magicians</h2>
		<p>They are the most dedicating and hardworking people of the Nation. So we should respect them. A farmer is a person who feeds him self and as well as his family by a very less amount of income even after working very hard and this is the fact of their world.
			<p>Indian farmers are the backbones of our nation’s economy as Indian economy is primarily Agriculture based country. Statics reveal that Indian agriculture is sector accounting for 18% of india’s Gross Demostic Product(GDP) and provide employment to nearly 50% of workers. Unfortunately despite being the main people in such industry ,Indian farmers are constantly subjected Harassment, Unemployment or lower payment of crops and such other things subjecting them into incur losses and face Poverty. India is the largest producer of wheat,rice,pulses and spices and has more scope for groth in agricultural sector. </p>

		<p>Farmer’s most important sources of satisfaction were; Pride of ownership, Making a satisfactory income, Self-respect by doing a worthwhile job, Meeting a challenge, Enjoyment of work tasks, and Ensuring a future income. Low importance was attributed to; Expanding the business, Continuing the family tradition, and Recognition or prestige (low to lowest). In the opinion of farmers, what makes a good farmer is (from the highest); Leaves the land better than they found it, Cares for their workers and family, Is most satisfied with their life, and Is progressive/up-to-date/experimental. The least important were (to the least important); Own their land, Is a leader in the farming community, Is not in debt.</p>

		<p>"Agriculture is our wisest pursuit, because it will in the end contribute most to real wealth, good morals & happiness." "The farmer has to be an optimist or he wouldn't still be a farmer." "A good farmer is nothing more nor less than a handy man with a sense of humus."Farmer: We Feed The World. Farmers are respectable and interesting to me in proportion as they are poor. Farmers are the founders of human civilization. Farming Is A Profession Of Hope.The main reason is to level up our farmer's quality and demand new innovation from them. ... As an expression to respect the farmers, I guess we can accommodates their needs by giving new innovation to their job. Providing IT access and an easiness to sustain their business are more than enough.<p><b>Farmer works in the field and they know every single condition within the field. Thus, I believe this situation drives them to act as supervisor in the real life. Becoming farmer doesn’t mean they don’t have role in the nation, because they are the one who have access to control and supervise the reality inside the farm. It’s not easy to manage field since you have to deal with plant disease and any other risks that would come.</b></p>
